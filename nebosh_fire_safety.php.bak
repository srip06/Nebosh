				<p>
				International General Certificate (IGC1) is the core unit for all of the NEBOSH International Health and Safety Certificates, so to advance a NEBOSH Certificate you need to study IGC1 along with the applicable specialist unit and practical assessment. <br /><br />	
				If you have been awarded a <a href="http://www.nebosh.org.uk/Qualifications/Awards/default.asp?cref=633&ct=2" target="_blank">NEBOSH International Certification </a>the last 5 years and wish to take another, you will be exempt from IGC1 and can simply add the specialist unit (IFC1) and practical assessment (IFC2) to achieve the new award. <br /><br />
